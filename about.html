            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <h2>Introduction</h2>
            <p>
                I'm Juan Narvaez, an argentinean programmer who enjoys solving programming challenges, and really
                excited about technology and the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since I was a child I always had contact with computers and I love working with them, that's
                and other reasons I'll explain later, is why today I'm studying computer science, I hope to work 
                in the future developing artificial intelligence, which is my area of interest.
            </p>
            <p>
                This was a brief introducction, if you want to know more feel free to continue reading this page.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Education</h2>
            <p>
                I am a student of Computer Science at Universidad Nacional de Cordoba.
            </p>
            <p>
                Why computer science? Since my childhood I always wondered how an electronic device could run
                games or play videos, but when I discovered that a computer could distinguish between a dog
                and a cat, or recognize handwriting, it was a turning point in what I wanted to study, I realized
                that a robot with the necessary tools could do things out of our imagination without the basic
                human limitations such as rest, that's why I am interested in artificial intelligence, and that's
                why I chose to study computer science, as it is the best approach to the study of artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Interest and Hobbies</h2>
            <p>
                I like to listen to tango, rock and classical music, although I not only listen to it, I also play tango and
                classical music, I am a really good pianist, and my greatest achievement was to play "Violin Concerto No. 2, Op. 35
                in B minor" by Oskar Rieding in duet with a violinist.
            </p>
            <p>
                I am also interested not only in artificial intelligence but also in bioinformatics, not only because
                it will have a very important role in the future but because before choosing computer science as my
                career, I wanted to be a doctor, that's because I am curious about how the human body works and the
                interactions with diseases, and by the altruistic sense of eliminating diseases.
            </p>
            <p>
                I also like games, watching funny videos and programming :D
            </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Current Goals</h2>
            <p>

            <h2>Very Long Term Goals</h2>
            <p>

                    Be the scientist that discovered the singularity, or immortality (biological or technological), 
                    or simply someone who made important contributions to science.
